  abstract = {The main aim of gamification, i.e. the implementation of game design elements in real-world contexts for non-gaming purposes, is to foster human motivation and performance in regard to a given activity. Previous research, although not entirely conclusive, generally supports the hypothesis underlying this aim. However, previous studies have often treated gamification as a generic construct, neglecting the fact that there are many different game design elements which can result in very diverse applications. Based on a self-determination theory framework, we present the results of a randomized controlled study that used an online simulation environment. We deliberately varied different configurations of game design elements, and analysed them in regard to their effect on the fulfilment of basic psychological needs. Our results show that badges, leaderboards, and performance graphs positively affect competence need satisfaction, as well as perceived task meaningfulness, while avatars, meaningful stories, and teammates affect experiences of social relatedness. Perceived decision freedom, however, could not be affected as intended. We interpret these findings as general support for our main hypothesis that gamification is not effective per se, but that specific game design elements have specific psychological effects. Consequences for further research, in particular the importance of treatment checks, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Gamification is increasingly becoming a pertinent aspect of any UI and UX design. However, a canonical dearth in research and application of gamification has been related to the role of individual differences in susceptibility to gamification and its varied designs. To address this gap, this study reviews the extant corpus of research on tailored gamification (42 studies). The findings of the review indicate that most studies on the field are mostly focused on user modeling for a future personalization, adaptation, or recommendation of game elements. This user model usually contains the users’ preferences of play (i.e., player types), and is mostly applied in educational settings. The main contributions of this paper are a standardized terminology of the game elements used in tailored gamification, the discussion on the most suitable game elements for each users’ characteristic, and a research agenda including dynamic modeling, exploring multiple characteristics simultaneously, and understanding the effects of other aspects of the interaction on user experience.},

In this paper, we investigate the potential of gamification to foster knowledge retention using an action research approach. We present the results from a longitudinal study including 617 secondary and tertiary education students conducted over a period of two years. Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non-gamified workshop designs, tested and refined over time. The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature. We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention. We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter. The steady increase in students’ learning performance resulting from constant refinement of the workshops demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating gamification principles into educational activities.},

A total of 70 students were enrolled in this study from an asynchronous online undergraduate level political science course. The study findings suggested that the gamification approach only had positive effects on the students' number of comments and performance in online discussions who were more aware of the gamification approach. However, it appears that the gamification approach failed in promoting students' sense of community. Additionally, students' responses to the interviews and open-ended questions revealed similar results, although more students in the gamified group indicated that the online discussions forced them to think hard. The limited influence of the gamification approach in the current study may be attributed to several factors that related to the facilitation of the gamification approach, the types of badges, and technical issues. Implications and suggestions for future research have been discussed.},

Our findings show that the story-based game, Forgotten Island, was strongly preferred over the points-based game, Happy Match. Participants indicated that this was because of “diegesis” in Forgotten Island – in other words, a focus on story-motivated activities and rewards made the citizen science task more enjoyable and gave participants various reasons to continue play. This study suggests that story-based games can be a powerful tool for attracting participants to citizen science tasks. In particular, compared to point-based games, story-based games may be more useful for attracting and engaging participants who are ambivalent about scientific inquiry. This paper also discusses some of the challenges and possibilities for both points-based and story-based gamification.},

This paper aims to investigate how a game-based learning approach influences the achievement and motivation of historical learning through a mobile learning environment. We propose game-based historical learning using the role-playing game on a mobile platform. The implementation is based on the history of the first army general in Indonesia, General Sudirman. The game was tested to 63 Junior High School students in Jakarta. Based on the evaluation, using the game can increase student learning motivation and learning achievement.},

  abstract = {A modern and successful tackle on education is represented by new teaching techniques which imply online courses, collaborative assignments, dynamic grading systems, real-time feedback and motivational inserts into the process of learning. Elearning together with massive open online courses (MOOCs) have seen a recent rise in popularity and integrate many of the aspects that enable distant students to take part in higher levels of education. While the perspective of migrating towards a pure online environment is in line with the trend of the younger generations, most professional and intellectual skills can only be effectively learned through physical attendance and practical guided work. Yet, the main concern highlighted in this paper is the weak point of most classic educational systems: the constant decreasing motivation it gives students - individuals who have grown and are embedded in many virtual realities form where they draw the needed intrinsic motivation and energy. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an educational platform named Gamified, which simplifies the educational and grading systems in modern schools and universities. It relies on the fundamental aspects of the theory of Gamification, namely bringing motivational elements from (video) games into non-game contexts. It does this through the abandonment of grades (seen by us as negative feedback, a demotivator), and integration of heroes, accumulated experience, levels, level-ups, achievements, quests, guilds, and other representative elements taken from role-playing games (positive feedback at different levels of motivation). Not only do these elements sound familiar to a vast majority of todays students, but they also trigger interest in the new approach to learning. We validate this technique over a period of 3 years on different generations of college students, compare the results with control groups, a present what we believe is remarkable feedback - both in terms of grades and participation, as well as in student attitude towards learning.},

Previous research has adopted several different angles and remains fragmented. Taking both an observational and explanatory perspective, we examined the theoretical foundations used in research on gamification, serious games and game-based learning through a systematic literature review and then discussed the commonalities of their core assumptions. The overview shows that scientists have used a variety of 118 different theories. Most of them share explicitly formulated or conceptual connections. From their interrelations, we derived basic principles that help explain how gamification works: Gamification can illustrate goals and their relevance, nudge users through guided paths, give users immediate feedback, reinforce good performance and simplify content to manageable tasks. Gamification mechanics can allow users to pursue individual goals and choose between different progress paths, while the system can adapt complexity to the user's abilities. Social gamification elements may enable social comparison and connect users to support each other and work towards a common goal.},

Termed massive open online courses (MOOCs), these soon fell into different categories, depending on their concept. Among them are connectivist massive open online courses (cMOOCs) which emphasise a collaborative approach to learning. However, while initial enrolment is indeed massive, completion rates are very low and cMOOCs notoriously lack an appropriate method of evaluating learning progress and motivational resources. The author of this article suggests that one way of addressing this problem might be to adapt motivational formative assessment tools used in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) to cMOOCs. He argues that some characteristics of MMORPGs can be effectively incorporated in cMOOCs, thus benefiting from the motivational potential of MMORPGs. He cautions, however, that even if MMORPGs (and ongoing, low-stakes formative assessment in general) are motivational, they can only be applied to cMOOCs if the idea of formative assessment is not in tension with connectivist principles. Hence, the author argues for their compatibility, and builds on peer-to-peer assessment as a solution for resource allocation problems with low instructor--learner ratio.},

This paper aims to analyze students' opinions about the use of Gamification and Digital Game-Based Learning to teach calculus using an RPG Game and to test a prototype with a group of users. The development of the Fellowship of the Calculus game has three phases: pre-production, production and post-production, in conjunction with the Game Design Document (GDD). A questionnaire was applied to 26 calculus students and a game prototype has been tested with six students to date. Preliminary results show that most of the students enjoy digital games, feel engaged when using the app and would like to play the game as a complement to their studies to help their learning process. The prototype test led to a positive expectation from the students, who showed high interest in using the game in their studies. The prospective work includes applying the game in curriculum to analyze the students' performance and to contribute to the use of computers in the education field. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract            = {A number of gamification approaches have been used to encourage greater student motivation and engagement in the classroom. This paper examines a gamification strategy that is less common in the classroom, despite its prevalence in successful games: role playing. Role playing games (RPGs) use a combination of character traits, experience points, and character leveling to illustrate how a character evolves and grows stronger as the character progresses through the game. By providing strong connections between the player's behavior and choices and how their in-game character develops, RPGs encourage players to identify with and develop a sense of ownership over their in-game character or persona. In order to encourage adoption of positive student habits and encourage belief in positive values of student behavior, we describe how RPG elements such as experience points, leveling, and character traits can be adapted for use in computer programming activities. By providing feedback on time management behavior, use of incremental software development practices, and consistent self-checking of one's work, gamification elements can be strategically structured to reinforce specific behaviors and to communicate that specific student practices or work habits are valued. By structuring RPG character traits to convey an implicit model of 'desirable or 'strong student behavior, students can use their character development status to track how well they are modeling these behaviors. Further, by providing a way for a student to identify with an empathize with an 'in-assignment representation of their personal behavior, RPG elements promote greater student ownership over their own experiences and greater personal investment in improving their work habits. We rely on existing measures of student effort as they develop their solutions that are intended to measure productive work the student invests, and to promote growth mindset beliefs. We show how these measures can be used to provide gamification-based rewards for target behaviors, such as time management choices, incremental development, and self-checking. Finally, we show how these elements can be embedded in an automated grading tool to provide a platform for embedding RPG-like experiences in assignment feedback. We apply these techniques to a historical data-set of student activities including 257 students to verify the feasibility and suitability of the design. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

It is in this context that with this project we seek to demonstrate how the digital Role-Playing Game (RPG) can be used as a tool for (supporting) teaching and learning in different subject areas (Portuguese, English, Mathematics, Natural Sciences and History), in the contexts of the 1st and 2nd Cycles of Basic Education in Portugal. Taking into account an ethnographic approach, which combines qualitative and quantitative methodologies and data triangulation, we intend with this pilot project: a) to analyse the state of the art regarding research projects focused on gamified approaches, in particular using RPG games on teaching and learning process; b) to analyze the representations of pupils and teachers about the gamified approach and the role-playing game; c) to create a digital platform based on RPG for the recreation of the teaching and learning process, validating the didactic modules / paths for their implementation in teaching contexts; d) to analyse the impacts of using the platform, namely with regard to pupils' knowledge and resources in the different curricular contents. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We empirically investigate this by exploring the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on the participation and performance of over 100 undergraduate students in an online gamified learning intervention. The paper makes a number of contributions. First, by synthesizing the literature the central concepts required for a learning intervention to be considered gamified are mapped and the development of an online gamified learning intervention is described. Second, the effect of gamification on learning outcomes is examined using a pre- and post-intervention survey. We find that gamified learning interventions have a positive impact on student learning. Third, our results show that while generally positive, the impact of gamified intervention*ns on student participation varies depending on whether the student is motivated intrinsically or extrinsically. These findings will be of practical interest to teaching and learning practitioners working in a range of educational contexts, and at all levels of education, who wish to increase student engagement and enhance learning. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Researchers and practitioners are anchored to the use of points, badges, and leaderboards, rarely introducing novel design solutions coming from games. In this article, I propose to look at World of Warcraft (WoW) to find insights for designing novel online communities based on gamified features. By exploring through an ethnographic work how WoW "shapes" its players' social relations and how specific "social game elements" impact on their subjective experiences, I will propose a series of design suggestions that could be employed to "enhance" the user experience within online communities in domain as diverse as learning, fitness, and crowdsourcing.

Storification, employed in physical learning environments and in teaching practices, supported pedagogy and decreased student misconduct at the school. Storified pedagogy empowered students through story morals and a sense of transportation, and enabled classrooms to turn into personalized spaces, enhancing the school experience and students’ academic performance.},

The idea of turning education into a game has received much attention in the last few years. This concept is different from traditional forms of game-based learning, which focus on the benefits of embedding commercial games or so-called “serious games”—games designed to teach specific content—into learning environments, a practice that boasts countless examples, hundreds of research studies, and at least a half-dozen meta-analyses.1 Rather, it hinges upon the idea of turning the classroom itself—whether it be a traditional brick-and-mortar space or an online virtual space—into a game by revamping pedagogy and curricula to look and feel more like games. These efforts are part of a larger trend called “gamification.”},

This suggests that engineering programs need to go beyond simply offering industry-based capstone courses and internships. Role-play has a long history as a tool for learning. It can be used to simulate real world practices in environments where consequences can be mitigated safely. This paper discusses the use of team role-play activities to simulate the experience of working in a professional, game development studio as a means of enhancing an advanced undergraduate game design course. In conjunction with the role-play, a gamification framework was used within the course to allow students to customize their course participation. Gamification was used to reward students for compliance with software process steps and for taking the initiative to improve their “soft skills”. In this project allowing students to negotiate the nature of their activities and rewards helped them develop those skills. The student feedback obtained and the authors’ own lessons learned are being used to plan the next iteration of this course.},

Although aforementioned studies have mentioned a broad range of factors that may influence gamification, they neither depicted the actual design features nor relative attractiveness among them. This study aims to identify attractive gamification features for collaborative storytelling websites. We first constructed a hierarchical system structure of gamification design of collaborative storytelling websites and conducted a focus group interview with eighteen frequent users to identify 35 gamification features. After that, this study determined the relative attractiveness of these gamification features by administrating an online survey to 6333 collaborative storytelling websites users. The results indicated that the top 10 most attractive gamification features could account for more than 50\% of attractiveness among these 35 gamification features. The feature of unpredictable time pressure is important to website users, yet not revealed in previous relevant studies. Implications of the findings were discussed. },

But all these elements are common in all games. What is that element that makes a game unique? Storytelling predates writing, and it was the only way at some point to tell a story and pass it on from generation to generation. Nowadays, we often see a new term called, gamification. What is gamification and what relation does it have with storytelling? Is storytelling an essential element to gamification? Gamification as a term is nothing more than taking game mechanics and applying them to something that already exists in order to motivate and make it more appealing.

The tools also should aid in the development of student competencies, a key objective of the new educational model of Tecnologico de Monterrey, the Tec21 model. In this context, an interactive approach involving app with elements of gamification and storytelling has been designed and tested in our project. Results showed that the students felt motivated after using the app (p value <{\thinspace}0.05). The element of gamification showed to be attractive to the students, but the tool of storytelling did not result that attractive (p value <{\thinspace}0.05 and p value >{\thinspace}0.05, respectively). Interestingly, students would recommend the use of this app to other students and professors (p value <{\thinspace}0.05). Additionally, most of the students approved the test involving the fundamentals of the central dogma of biology---a series of processes that cells use when replicating and when fabricating proteins, and a substantial majority of students felt that videos related to this topic are helpful. Thus, this app, Bio3D, can be considered in its first-version level as satisfactory in its measures of increasing student motivation and improving the teaching--learning process regarding the central dogma of biology. Further work will entail the upgrade of this app to include augmented reality in order to generate a full technological platform supporting efforts to increase the interaction and participation of the students and the professor in the course, thus enhancing the teaching--learning process.},

  abstract = {Marketing is changing and companies or brands try to find new ways to engage consumers and involve them in their advertising efforts. There are two new communication strategies that might be able to lead the way into a new area of advertising and marketing: transmedia storytelling and gamification. The research questions were how to use such strategies in the communication or branding environment and how to use them when a global brand wants to communicate across cultures while adapting the approach to each individual one. In this study a case analysis of Coca-Cola advertising campaigns was conducted. Cases containing both transmedia storytelling and gamification elements as well having a cultural variation were selected for investigation. Results show that there are many elements that can be used to tell a story across media or to gamify advertising. Transmedia storytelling elements are for example emotions, content that provokes talking about the story or the use of a story across different media platforms. Gamification elements that are used in advertising are rewards and prizes, time pressure, reputation and rank indicators or feedback mechanisms. Such ingredients can be used flexibly and can also be adapted to local cultural traits and values. Since both techniques are highly engaging they might change advertising in the future},

We proposed a role-playing game where kids acted as designers and developers of a serious game, which would aid other children in the learning of fractions. The experience has been very fruitful both for us and for the children. On one hand, they had an exciting experience as game developers, and enforced their knowledge about fractions.

According to several researches, most frameworks for gamification already developed are structural (e.g. scoring systems, ranking, etc.), with very few content-related frameworks. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known narrative framework available. Therefore this paper analyses data obtained from a survey about the students' preferred game elements in an educational context, using Association Rule Mining and focusing on the rules found concerning Narrative and Storytelling elements.

It reveals the latest scientiﬁc research evidence on the emerging trends of learning technologies and gamiﬁcation plugins along with extending the possibilities for future research directions in revolutionizing learning and instruction through gamiﬁcation. A systematic literature review examined the thematic and content analysis of 46 empirical research papers published in the Web of Science database between 2016 and 2019. The review critically appraised and evaluated the various contradictions found in the literature along with setting the stage for the signiﬁcance of future research studies to re-examine the theoretical foundations of gamiﬁcation, its methodological approaches, theoretical models, gaming platforms and apps, game mechanics and learning outcomes. This study not only attempts to shed light on the novelty of gamiﬁed learning perceived as a game-changer and key enabler of motivation, engagement, and user experience but also sought to outline the key challenges and barriers of gamiﬁcation.},

  abstract      = {The teaching-learning of Computer Programming involves challenges that imply searching for new teaching methodologies in which the student is actively involved. Currently, methodologies related to games are widely used due to the effects they can generate in aspects such as motivation, participation, academic performance and student engagement. Gamification is immersed in these methodologies, referring to the use of game-related elements in non-game contexts. In the area of computer programming, studies have been conducted that integrate computer-assisted gamification in academic contexts, with the aim of demonstrating the real effects generated by the use of game-related elements in training processes. Generally, qualitative results show remarkable effects in the different aspects analyzed, however, different studies where quantitative analyses are performed contradict these findings and expose that integrating gamification does not generate statistically significant effects in evaluated aspects such as motivation, participation, academic performance, among others. The analyzed literature review shows the need to conduct more empirical studies in which gamification is integrated in order to understand and demonstrate the real effects it generates in the different formative aspects. 

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to find the effect that computer-assisted gamification has on the learning motivation of Computer Programming students. To this end, a quasi-experimental study was designed and carried out in which a gamified tool was integrated into the methodology of an Introduction to Computer Programming course. Through a literature review and a comparative analysis, the selection of CodeGym as the computer-assisted gamified environment suitable for integration into the classroom methodology was made. Next, the design of the quasi-experimental study was established in which the methodology of the educational intervention and the application of the instruments to measure the motivational construct by means of the self-report questionnaire MSLQ-Colombia and a survey of perceptions directed to the students who participated in the study were proposed. Forty-eight students participated in this study, distributed in two control groups and one experimental group, who were selected by means of a non-probabilistic convenience sampling technique. 

The information collected allowed a statistical analysis of the variation of motivation in each of the participating groups. The quantitative information obtained through the MSLQ-Colombia showed that the students in the experimental group in which the gamified environment was integrated into the classroom methodology, significantly increased the levels related to task valuation, attributing a higher degree of importance, usefulness, liking or interest in the topics presented in the subject. The results reported in this research allow a better understanding of the effects, benefits, and challenges provided by the integration of computer-assisted gamification in the teaching-learning process of computer programming.},

For this, a didactic proposal was designed that was developed in 4 phases and that contributed to the development of competencies in natural sciences proposed by the Ministry of National Education in the basic standards of sixth grade, in particular the competency of compressive use of scientific knowledge. which consists of the student understanding and using concepts, theories and models that allow him to solve problems, for this, the methodology of problem-based learning, gamification and ICT was used. This didactic proposal was developed in a group of 30 sixth grade students of basic education from the León XIII educational institution in the municipality of El Peñol, Antioquia. A large part of the population under study comes from the rural area of the municipality, therefore the implementation of this proposal is also a contribution to the teaching of science in rural education in Colombia. The development of the work was achieved through a classroom project as a didactic strategy and included the following phases: 1. Previous knowledge workshop 2.

The work is of a qualitative nature and is theoretically based on the critical significant learning of Moreira (2005), allowing to improve investigative capacities and to understand the interrelationship between the planet, life and living beings, developing critical thinking that encourages him to explore and analyze natural phenomena and formulate alternatives that help to improve their current living conditions and their environment.
Some of the great contributions when carrying out the research project was the development by the students of a scientific language, to refer to each and every one of the elements that are constitutive of the environment and the social dynamics that man weaves with East. In the same sense, there are the competences and skills acquired to explain phenomena that are the product of human actions or of nature itself.

From there, and from the experiences gathered in the pedagogical practice, the interest arises in seeking a bridge between Ecology, Gamification, ICT and Reading. An ICT-mediated gamified teaching strategy was developed for teaching ecology concepts through reading. The logical thinking was compared, applying a pre-test and post-test to 30 tenth grade students, and an opinion rubric was applied to students and experts. The results show a positive impact on attention, readiness for learning, and improvement of the classroom environment. Regarding knowledge in Ecology, the results were statistically insignificant, as a consequence of aspects such as the academic situation, the family context and the mood of the students. It is suggested to incorporate other strategies to further favor the learning process, and minimize the negative influence of these variables on classroom work.},

Situation reflected in the Saber test reports (2015 - 2016) made by the ICFES (national) and TIMMS tests, 2015 (international). This is an action research, its objective is to introduce an innovative methodology in the teachinglearning process to improve the academic performance of the students of the institution. The sample: six teachers from the area of mathematics. The methodology used is Gamification learning strategy for learning mathematics with the support of the Smartick platform. Its development was made in several stages: initially, a diagnostic phase consisting of a theoretical review of the research category: academic performance and gamification; In addition, the use of a series of surveys applied to teachers and students and the review of academic reports were the basis of the collection. In this context, six workshops were developed in order to prepare teachers to implement the strategy in classrooms; at the end the group evaluates the results obtained and the relevance of the strategy, the main conclusions of the study revolve around the varied uses of strategies that allow to capture the attention of the students, monitor the explicit motivations so that it does not affect the work of the classroom and the main thing to have fun together with the students},

This research has a qualitative perspective with an evaluative descriptive scope, addressing the methodological design of the case study, taking into account the category of communicative competence of English where the subcategories are: linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic, and based on the category of gamification.
The study is divided into three phases. It begins by identifying the students' level of communicative competence through the initial instrument, taking as a reference the subcategories and dimensions proposed by the CEFR, from which a four-session didactic strategy was designed with the elements typical of gamification such as the dynamics, mechanics and components of the game, and ended by applying the final instrument.
Through the analysis of the results it was possible to demonstrate that with the application of the didactic strategy some students presented significant advances in the strengthening of the communicative competence, especially in the speaking and listening skills where they showed greater fluency when communicating, going from the A1 to A2 or A2 to B1 scale. Furthermore, it was observed that the didactic strategy had a positive influence on awakening the interest and motivation of the students in learning the English foreign language.
In conclusion, these types of didactic strategies contribute to the processes of teaching and learning the English language},

Despite the processing capabilities and the already embedded sensors in smart phones, integrating pollution sensors into cellphones is still an ambitious project. Pollution-Spots proposes a solution by means of using an infrastructure of fixed low-cost sensing devices, and reporting the measurements using Participatory Sensing. The system s name comes from the static sensing units which function as spots the mobile user canhook-up to in order to obtain the environmental data. This model is easier to escalate, since it does not require users carrying the sensing devices. To enlarge the region of interest you only need to install a Pollution-Spot. The device starts measuring and the pedestrian forwards the information, completing the cycle with no extra cost of data transport and/or human resources. A case study located in Pontificia Universidad Javeriana s campus presents the system s performance. The maps obtained based on the gathered data provide good visualization of the variables of interest, proving the effectiveness of the system. These results show the benefits of applying this model in areas with scarce monitoring stations and/or Budget limitations. Also, including user participation makes it possible to design applications that improve communities quality of life, since the maps obtained allow to identify the areas where the concentration of pollutant is critical.},
